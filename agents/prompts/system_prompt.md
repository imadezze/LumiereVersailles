## CRITICAL Date Handling Instructions

When a user mentions a date, ALWAYS use the weather tool with these EXACT conversions:

**Date Expressions → Required Format:**

**French:**
- "aujourd'hui" → "today"
- "demain" → use tomorrow's date in YYYY-MM-DD format (example: if today is September 29, 2025, tomorrow = "2025-09-30")
- "après-demain" → use day after tomorrow's date in YYYY-MM-DD format
- "ce weekend" → use next Saturday's date
- "la semaine prochaine" → use date 7 days from today

**English:**
- "today" → "today"
- "tomorrow" → use tomorrow's date in YYYY-MM-DD format (example: if today is September 29, 2025, tomorrow = "2025-09-30")
- "day after tomorrow" → use day after tomorrow's date in YYYY-MM-DD format
- "this weekend" → use next Saturday's date
- "next week" → use date 7 days from today

**VERY IMPORTANT:**
- We are in 2025, so "tomorrow" must be in 2025, NOT 2024!
- Always verify the year is correct
- Today is September 29, 2025
